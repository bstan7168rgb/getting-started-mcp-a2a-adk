A sample multi-agent system demonstrating **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and 
**Agent2Agent (A2A)** working together with **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. 
All services can be run completely locally or fully deployed to Google Cloud Run.

## Overview

The sample aims at laying out a foundation and showcasing the capabilities
of MCP + A2A + ADK.

### <img height="20" width="20" src="images/mcp-favicon.ico" alt="MCP Logo" /> Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. - [Anthropic](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

The MCP server in this example exposes a tool `get_exchange_rate` that can be used to get the exchange rate between two currencies such as USD and EUR. It leverages the [Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.dev/) API to get the currency exchange rate. Our agent uses an MCP client to invoke this tool when needed.

### <img height="20" width="20" src="https://a2a-protocol.org/v0.2.5/assets/a2a-logo-black.svg" alt="A2A Logo" /> Agent2Agent (A2A)

> Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol addresses a critical challenge in the AI landscape: enabling gen AI agents, built on diverse frameworks by different companies running on separate servers, to communicate and collaborate effectively - as agents, not just as tools. A2A aims to provide a common language for agents, fostering a more interconnected, powerful, and innovative AI ecosystem. - [A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A)

In this sample, ADK is used to expose `currency_agent` as an A2A server and consume it from `travel_agent` as a remote A2A agent (`RemoteA2aAgent` / `RemoteA2AAgent`).

### <img height="20" width="20" src="images/adk-favicon.ico" alt="ADK Logo" /> Agent Development Kit (ADK)

> ADK is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. - [ADK](https://adk.dev/)

ADK is used as the orchestration framework for creating our agents in this sample. It handles the conversation with the user, serves the Web UI, invokes our MCP tool when needed, and handles the A2A communication.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system consists of 1 orchestrating agent with Web UI, 1 remote agent via A2A, 1 local agent tool, and 1 MCP server:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Key Components

- **`currency_mcp_server/`**: An MCP server exposing the `get_exchange_rate` tool over Streamable HTTP (`/mcp`), backed by the public [Frankfurter API](https://api.frankfurter.dev/).
- **`currency_agent/`**: An ADK agent connected to the MCP server via `McpToolset`. Exposed as an A2A service.
- **`travel_agent/`**: A travel assistant ADK agent serving the ADK Web UI. It coordinates between:
  - **`weather_agent`** (in `travel_agent/subagents/`): A **local agent wrapped as an `AgentTool`**, demonstrating in-process agent tool usage without A2A network hops.
  - **`currency_agent`**: A **remote agent wrapped as an `AgentTool`**, delegating requests over the A2A protocol.

> [!TIP]
> Because MCP and A2A are open wire protocols, you can even mix and match the Python and Java services across languages!
